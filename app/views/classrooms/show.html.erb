Classroom Info

<%= @classroom.course_name %>
<%= @classroom.semester %>

We now want to call out the oldest student in the class:
<%= render 'classroom' %>




<%= @classroom.all%>

# # they also want to add some search functionality so that a user can
# search for a student by name. It's okay if other students with similar names are
# returned in the search results.
